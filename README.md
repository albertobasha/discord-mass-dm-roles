# Discord Mass DM Roles With Bot
This script allows you to send a direct message (DM) to all members of a specific role on a Discord server using a bot.

# Prerequisites
- You must have a Discord bot account and know its token.
- You must have the `discord.py` library installed.
- You must have the `colorama` library installed.
- You should have basic knowledge of Python programming.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal in the project's root directory.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Open the `mass_dm.py` file in a text editor and enter your bot's token in the appropriate place.
5. Enter the role ID of the role you want to send the DMs to.
6. Enter the message you want to send.
7. Enter the time interval between DMs in seconds (to avoid ratelimit).
8. Save the changes and run the script by typing `python mass_dm.py` in the command prompt or terminal.

# Note
Please be aware that using this script to mass message members without their consent is against Discord's terms of service and can get your bot and potentially your account banned.
